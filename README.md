Project Name: The Monkees Website

Hello, my name is Rachel Shawe and I am the developer of The Monkees website, a website for fans. 
I created this website as the first milestone project on the Software Development course from the Code Institute. 
The remit was to create a band website, in this case The Monkees to highlight their music and publicise their availability to perform at various events. 

Audience: fans of the band and potential fans. 
User Stories
•	As I fan I want to know when and where the band are available to play so that I may book them for an event I am hosting. 
•	As a fan I want to see photos of the band so that I can stay up to date with the band’s work and events.
•	As a fan/potential fan I want access to the band’s social media pages so that I can follow their activity.
•	As a fan I want access to the band’s latest music and access to their older music so that I can continue to enjoy listening to them. 
•	As a potential fan I want to hear the band’s music through audio clips and/or video so that I can decide if I like their music.
